        "\n",
        "Tuples have fewer built-in methods because they are immutable. They only support methods like count() and index().\n",

        "The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary in Python is generally O(1), which means it takes constant time on average. This is because dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which allow for fast lookups by hashing keys. However, in the worst case scenario, where there are hash collisions and the hash table needs to be resized, the time complexity can degrade to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the dictionary. Despite this, dictionaries are highly efficient for accessing elements based on their keys, making them a preferred choice for storing and managing collections of data where quick access to values based on keys is important.\n",

This means that when iterating over a dictionary, the order of keys may not necessarily match the order in which they were inserted. This lack of order can affect data retrieval in scenarios where the order of elements matters, suchas when iterating over a dictionary in a specific order or when relying on the order of keys for logical operations.
